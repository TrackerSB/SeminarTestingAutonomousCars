\section{Summary}
\draft{%
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Secondary safety successful $=>$ primary getting more important
        \item $=>$ Estimate benefits of these advanced safety systems by simulating real world crashes
        \item Basis for simulation is the \gls{gidas}
        \item Compare real accident with predicted scenario using a virtual prototype of a safety system
        \item (Interactions between sensor systems, brakes and steering control can be considered)
        \item Simulate with more than one safety system
        \item Estimated benefit regards accident avoidance and/or accident mitigation
        \item ($=>$ Useful combinations of advanced safety systems)
        \item First simulate without active safety systems
        \item Then simulate with active safety systems like \gls{ebs} and \gls{ldw}
        \item Compare of physical parameters listed in paper
    \end{itemize}
}

\section{Critical Content}
\draft{%
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Steps extensively/detailed explained (Car with/without active safety systems)
        \item Parameters explicitly listed
        \item Detection lines
        \item Relies on really detailed description like in \gls{gidas} which may not always be available
        \item (The simulations virtual accident 1 and 2 of the turning off accident are quite similar)
        \item Differences of result using two different sensors in certain situations shown
        \item (Measure how good the safety systems are?)
        \item I would use since many steps of the approach, strategies and problems are explained and illustrated in detail
        \item It also includes illustrating examples
        \item Combinations of advanced safety systems can be tested
        \item I like the paper since it explains the approach precisely and understandable and illustrates it with multiple visualized examples
    \end{itemize}
