        \textbf{Why:} The estimation of benefits in the above paper is dependant on detailed descriptions of accident scenarios. This paper proposes a method for collecting tons of detailed critical scenarios which could be used for even more precise estimations.

        \textbf{Why:} The benefits of advanced safety systems depend in the above paper only on the scenario itself. This paper could be used to determine critical scenarios occurring very often and frequently leading to accidents. In such cases the estimation of benefits should be rated higher.

        \textbf{Why:} The benefits of advanced safety systems would be very interesting in the case of unsafe/critical intersections since these are typical scenarios resulting in accidents.
