### 2
- Previous appraoches search in input space
- Constructive algorithm
- Make a given scenario more critical
### 3
- drivable area
- less drivable area => higher criticality
### 4
- Rectangles = time steps
- Goal area after second obstacle
- increased speed
- changed static obstacle### 5
- increased speed
- Changed positions
- slightly different steering angle
Quite small --> another basic example
