### 2
- Previous appraoches search in input space
- Constructive algorithm
- Make a given scenario more critical### 3
- drivable area
- less drivable area => higher criticality### 4
- drivable area at each time step in simulation
- increased speed
- slightly different steering angle
Quite small --> another basic example### 5
- increased speed
- changed static obstacle
