        \textbf{How:} IEEEXplore search (author search: ``Matthias Althoff'')\par
        \textbf{Why:} The approach focuses on increasing the criticality of a test scenario only in terms of the solution space of the drivable area.
            The construction of test cases may be additionally guided by trying to find test scenarios for which the solution space requires triggering certain \gls{adas} like \gls{aeb}.

        In a real system the behavior of pedestrians could further influence the drivable area.

        \textbf{Why:} The approach may be extended by making the drivable area also depend on the physics of the autonomous vehicle to be able to test also other vehicles than cars.
