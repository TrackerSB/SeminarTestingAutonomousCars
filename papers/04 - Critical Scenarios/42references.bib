        \textbf{How:} IEEExplore search (Same author: ``Luigi del Re'')\par
        \textbf{Why:} The above paper states that the future work includes parameterizing more complex traffic situations. Since the overtake scenario is quite similar but more complex it would be a good candidate. Further this paper uses the same description of the position of the ego vehicle as the above paper does.

        \textbf{Why:} The focus of the above paper lies on realistic and relevant parameterizations of test scenarios. Provided that avoiding hard braking maneuvers is relevant the parameterization could be improved by concerning predictive control like in this paper.
