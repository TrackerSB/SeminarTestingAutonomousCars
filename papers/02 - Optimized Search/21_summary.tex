\section{Summary}
The paper discusses on finding critical test cases for simulation-based testing of vision-based control systems like \glspl{adas} based on evolutionary search algorithms.
The authors explain their approach using their results on \gls{aeb}.\par
To improve the effectiveness (in terms of finding regions of critical test scenarios in given search/parameter space) of evolutionary multi-objective search algorithms the approach combines them with decision trees.
Decision trees are repeatedly build after a few iterations of the evolutionary search algorithm.
Each edge of the decision tree represents constraints dividing the population of test cases of the previous node.
Each node represents a population of test scenarios fulfilling all the constraints annotated at the edges of the path from the root to this node.
Additionally every node has values (in \%) which describe the certainty finding critical or non-critical test cases.
If a node has more than 95\% criticality it is marked as critical region.\par
The following iterations of the evolutionary search algorithm concentrate on non-critical regions to identify more critical regions by dividing them in subregions using further constraints.\par
As a result the approach is able to characterize critical test scenarios by looking at nodes marked as critical region and the constraints they fulfill.

\section{Critical Content}
According to the paper ten \glspl{adas} were studied during the research but the only \gls{adas} explained is \gls{aeb}.
The paper mentions neither the results nor any analysis (not even the names) of the other nine \glspl{adas}.\par
In section 4.1 the paper lists many parameters and configurations but for some a value is only given a few pages later in section 5.3 (\eg{} the mutation rate).
In section 4.1 the mutation rate is only described as ``a probability''.
\draft{\(\eta\)?}\par
The title suggests that the research discusses multiple evolutionary search-based algorithms but the only one referred to is \gls{nsgaii}.\par
The section ``Benefits from a practitioner's perspective'' deals with exactly three people who are employees of the same company which is the same company supporting the research itself.
Additionally one of these three people is connected to the research team since he/she collaborated already with the research in a not specified way.\par
As a conclusion I do not like the paper and if I use the approach proposed by this paper I would at most use it for testing \gls{aeb}.

\section{Critical Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Did the other \glspl{adas} perform similar to \gls{aeb}?
    \item Do the results significantly change if another search-based algorithm like \gls{moead} is used?
\end{enumerate}
