\section{Summary}
When evaluating and verifying \glspl{adas} and \glspl{adf} even the case of simulations is very time consuming.
Therefore a test case catalog based on a traffic accident database was introduced in a previous paper to reduce the number of test scenarios to test.
Based on the catalog this approach develops a method for searching for a boundary dividing parameterizations for scenarios of the catalog into safe and unsafe conditions (\eg{} in terms of collision rate) using an iterative input design method based on \gls{gpc}.\par
The first iteration of \gls{gpc} starts with defining initial points which are classified as safe or unsafe.
As long as a given exit condition is not satisfied the boundary for all current points is generated and new input data is chosen which is also classified.
At the end the class boundary is numerically computed.

\section{Critical Content}
No research on the performance of the approach is done.\par
The approximation quality of the approach is not clear.
The quality is demonstrated on one example where ``it is desirable to find an exit condition depending on the current quality of the approximation''.
For the example the authors suppose the predictive probability as feasible exit condition but which is according to the paper not applicable in practice due to numerical errors and discretization of the input which is supposed to mis-trigger the exit condition.\par
I would not use this approach since the authors seem to not worry much about creating a very thought-out paper (\eg{} multiple mistakes in grammar, missing labels like in Fig.10, very few references), the approach itself is not profoundly described (\eg{} how new input data is chosen) and the approximation quality is according to the paper unknown (see section III.C).

\section{Critical Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item As the paper points out the approximation is sometimes getting worse temporarily presumably at edges of the true boundary.
        Is there another way to overcome this issue without defining a candidate set to pick new input data from?
    \item Is there any way to analyze the quality of the approximation?
\end{enumerate}
