\section{Summary}
Designing test cases for autonomous systems as well as live tests are very time consuming.
In contrast to other approaches this approach focuses on the relation between configuration and resulting performance instead of finding faulty behavior.\par
This paper introduces a method for generating test scenarios which are interesting in terms of test scenarios close to performance boundaries.
Therefore the performance boundary is defined as test cases where slight modifications to the configuration drastically change the resulting performance \eg{} are crucial to whether a tests succeeds or fails.\par
The approach starts with finding interesting/informative test scenarios using an iterative \gls{gpr} search algorithm which focuses on regions with high gradients since these indicate that there is a performance boundary.
The \gls{gpr} provides a model of a mean value, the gradient of the mean and an estimated variance for each prediction point \draft{prediction point?}.\par
These test scenarios are clustered based on \gls{dbscan} which identifies the performance boundaries.

\section{Critical Content}
\draft{%
    \begin{itemize}
        \item (Some aspects explained multiple times (``where small changes to the state space lead to large changes in performance'', ``We follow an active learning strategy''))
    \end{itemize}
}
The problem definition section is very short \draft{continue\ldots}\par
I would not use the approach yet since the performance in terms of time is not given and the future work of the paper includes scaling up the system for handling more dimensions and test cases.\par
I like the paper since the approach is \draft{continue\ldots}
