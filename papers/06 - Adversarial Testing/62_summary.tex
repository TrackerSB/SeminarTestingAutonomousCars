\section{Summary}
\draft{%
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Testing techniques for automatically generating tests
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Lack of diversity
                \item mismatch training and application domain
                \item \(=>\) compromise efficacy and reliability and degrade system accuracy
            \end{itemize}
        \item \(=>\) DeepRoad: unsupervised \gls{dnn} based framework for automatically testing the consistency of \gls{dnn} based autonomous driving systems and online validation.
        \item First, synthesize large amounts of diverse driving scenarios without using image transformation rules (with weather conditions) by applying \gls{gan}
        \item Second, utilizes metamorphic testing techniques to check consistency
        \item Third, Validate input images by measuring the distance of input and training images using their VGGNet features
        \item Test three well recognized \gls{dnn} based autonomous driving systems in Udacity \(=>\) Detected thousands of inconsistent behaviors and effectively validated input images to potentially enhance the systems robustness as well.
    \end{itemize}
}

\section{Critical Content}
\draft{%
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Includes citation
        \item Broadly explains benefits/advantages of DeepRoad compared to DeepXplore and DeepTest
        \item Mentions testing oracle problem
        \item Approach allows online input validation \(=>\) Could warn driver if the autonomous car is not able to handle the situation itself (\eg{} snow covered road)
        \item Contains section about threads to validity
        \item Inconsistent == Big change in steering angle after changing weather (Relies on steering angle prediction)
        \item Input validation == Distance between input and training images \(=>\) new images accepted? \(=>\) distance not proper metric
        \item Only one with hard rain and one with heavy snow \(=>\) Same car, same camera, same angle, similar/same road (only highway?, accidents?)
        \item Results shown in figure 8 quite impressive compared to the simple transformations of DeepTest
    \end{itemize}
}

\section{Critical Questions}
\draft{%
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Paper criticises other approaches lacking being able to handle disturbed input images. It does not evaluate whether DeepRoad successfully deals with that.
    \end{enumerate}
