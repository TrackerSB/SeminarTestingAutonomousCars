        \textbf{Why:} The generation of new test cases for DeepTest is heavily dependent on the seed images. This approach could be able to find seed images which are more likely to trigger erroneous behavior.

        \textbf{Why:} DeepTest is generating test cases by transforming seed images to increase the neuron coverage. Using this paper images which do not contribute to the coverage could be filtered out to minimize the test suite.
