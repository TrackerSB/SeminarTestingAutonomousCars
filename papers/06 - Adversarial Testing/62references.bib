        \textbf{Why:} The above paper proposes that DeepRoad is able to validate input images to potentially enhance the system robustness. This paper could be used to reduce the number of images really needed to retrain the \gls{dnn} under test.

        \textbf{Why:} This paper deals with stacked \glspl{gan} which are used to generate plausible images. The quality of the output images of DeepRoad may be further improved by using stacked \glspl{gan} for enhancing their plausibility.
