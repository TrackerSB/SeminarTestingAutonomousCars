\title{1.1 - Employing Multi-Objective Search to Enhance Reactive Test Case Generation and Prioritization for Testing Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems}

\section{Summary}
The paper concentrates on \ac{CPS}s and simulation-based testing which is currently the most commonly used technique for testing them.
Since simulation-based testing is very complex and computationally expensive the paper introduces a search-based approach with focus on cost-effectiveness of generation of test cases and prioritization of the generated test cases.
To define cost-effectiveness the search considers multiple objectives including \ac{TET}, \ac{RC}, \ac{TCS} and prioritization-aware \ac{TCS} described by a fitness function.
The definition of prioritization of generated test cases focuses on the objectives \ac{TET} and \ac{FDC}.\\
%The paper describes theses objectives as follows:\\
%The \ac{RC} is the number of requirements covered by a test suite divided by the total number of requirements of a \ac{CPS}.
%[The other objects]
Each of the initial test suites consists of randomly generated reactive test cases.
The approach generates new test suites  by applying a crossover operator and two mutation operators which add, remove, modify or exchange test cases within a test suite or interchange parts of test suites with other ones.
After each generation of a new test suite its cost-effectiveness is measured to assure its quality.\\
As a result choosing \ac{NSGA-II} as search algorithm (Apart from the defined similarity measures where \ac{MOEA/D} performed best), \(2/N\) as mutation rate where \(N\) is defined in section V.B.2 and 0.2 as crossover rate achieve the best performance for the approach.


\section{Critical Content}
% Where is the paper not accurate?
% Problems not tackled?
The paper mentions crossover and mutation operators for creating test suites out of existing test suites.
The test cases on which the operators are applied on are chosen randomly and the quality of the resulting test suites is checked afterwards.
Other strategies for selecting certain test cases beforehand are not described.\\
Section V.B.2 describes many parameters of configuration.
Since changes to the values of the parameters influence the performance of the algorithms justified value are used (Section V.E).
The changes to the results and the behavior are not further investigated.
